#Arithmetic and Geometric Sequence

You are required to check if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or if the array is empty.

- For arithmetic progressions, return `Arithmetic`
- For geometric progressions, return `Geometric`
- For neither of the above, return -1
- For an empty array, return 0

## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\ari-geo.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
